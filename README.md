# Vee: The Universal Package Installer 

❤🧡💛💚💙💜

Vee is a simple CLI script for installing packages directly from GitHub and other sources. It essentially combines the process of cloning an repository and then installing/building the package into a single, tiny command.

```sh
vee [owner]/[package]
```
